# Test Inserting Code

Can we insert code from another file?

{{< include code/test.qmd >}}

Yes we can!

::: {.callout-tip}
A couple of important things to remember when using computational includes:

1. All computations still share a single engine (e.g. knitr or jupyter)
1. Computational includes work only in `.qmd` files (they donâ€™t work in `.ipynb` notebook files)
