        "There are two main branches of technical computing: machine learning and\n",
        "scientific computing. Machine learning has received a lot of hype over the\n",
        "last decade, with techniques such as convolutional neural networks and TSne\n",
        "nonlinear dimensional reductions powering a new generation of data-driven\n",

        "However, there has been a recent convergence of the two disciplines. This field,\n",
        "scientific machine learning, has been showcasing results like how partial\n",
        "differential equation simulations can be accelerated with neural networks.\n",
        "New methods, such as probabilistic and differentiable programming, have\n",
        "started to be developed specifically for enhancing the tools of this domain.\n",
        "However, the techniques in this field combine two huge areas of computational\n",
